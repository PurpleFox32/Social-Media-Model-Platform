I wanted to say here too. I apologize for not finishing this. I don't know how close I am overall. I am have been working as hard as I could on this project but this whole unit (specifically lesson 5 through 10), there is just too much to be done in one week and some things that could be taught are left out because of the three week deadline. I know that you don't really have the power to change that and that all you can do is send a request to change things up. Although, I do want to say that I think this module should be split into two parts so we can get a better understanding of the Back End application and also so there can be topics that aren't currently talked about or mentioned. I would like more time to try and finish this. I will try and work on it as a side project if I can't be extended in my time with it. I will send it in when I have it entirely finished if you'd like. I don't give up easily when it comes to anything with computers. Coding, Designing, Troubleshooting, Anything at all. I always had, have, and as far as I know, always will have a passion for learning about technology in whatever way I can. I don't regret taking this course. Not one bit. Easily one of my best investments. I just think Back End Foundations should be spread out over six weeks instead of crammed into 3. I love this course and I love what it has done for me. I won't give up until I finish this project if I am granted more time (if that is possible). In all honesty, I have actually enjoyed Back End Foundations more than any other unit regardless of the time I spent working on it or the frustration that came from it. I like challenges. Anyways, I just think that Back End Foundations should be done in two units rather than one.
